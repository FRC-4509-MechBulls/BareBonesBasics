the amount of times we need to change something in the code.
Be sure to always declare them as public static so they can be used anywhere.
PLEASE DONT FORGET - Your organization is KEY you will waste more
time looking for something rather than coding if you dont keep it clean
I recomend grouping your constants by reletivity and comenting them.*/
